## Overview
We went to Japan for ~13 days in September/October 2019. Here's our itinerary and our thoughts on what is worth it, what isn't, and tips along the way. We mostly travel to eat so most of our links are going to be food recs.

For context, here are what cities we were in on what day of our trip:

We flew out on a Saturday AM (from California) - 13 hours + timezone differences, landed Sunday PM. <br>
**Day 0, 1** - Tokyo <br>
**Day 2, 3** - Osaka > Kobe (Day Trip) <br>
**Day 4** - Osaka > Kobe (Day Trip) > Kyoto <br>
**Day 5, 6** - Kyoto (Central) <br>
**Day 7** - Kyoto > Nara (Day Trip) > Kyoto <br>
**Day 8** - Kyoto (Central) > Kyoto (West/Arashiyama) <br>
**Day 9** - Kyoto (Arashiyama) > Lake Kawaguchi <br>
**Day 10** - Lake Kawaguchi > Tokyo <br>
**Day 11, 12** - Tokyo <br>

Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto split was 4days/2.5days/4.5days, roughly.

We were too early for the Autumn leaves (though there was some), so if you want to catch it, go late October.

## General/Multi-city

- Get a pocket wifi, use google maps, it's generally pretty good to get you around. Just don't trust google maps for where the bus stops are.
    - [klook](https://www.klook.com/en-US/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> & [kkday](https://www.kkday.com/en){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> have some of the cheapest I've found.
- There are coin lockers at train stations and scattered everywhere, for a few dollars you can lock up your heavy bags so you can roam around more comfortably, I highly recommend it. Most take IC Cards (like Pasmo), and some take coins.

### Accommodation Recommendations

- We stayed in a capsule hotel called Millennials in [Kyoto](https://the-millennials-kyoto-jp.book.direct/en-us){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> that we liked a lot and they have one in [Shibuya](https://the-millennials-shibuya-shibuya-ku-jp.book.direct/en-gb){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. There's a youtube review [here](https://youtu.be/dxDoDljueBg?t=127){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
- We stayed in Airbnb before (in Toyko, Kyoto) and it was really great, affordable too!

### Food Recs

- [Excellent] [A Happy Pancake](https://magia.tokyo/shop){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> for fluffy pancakes
    - The pancakes not only looks good but are actually *really* good. There's a lot of locations in Tokyo and also in Kyoto.
- [Good] Do try Ichiran and Ippudo ramen, they are a chain all over Japan, I personally like Ippudo more.
- [Good] I love Japanese instant ramen. Try them, they are *delicious*, so much better than the ones in America.
- [Good] Japanese convenience store are famous. Check out some youtube suggestions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3kxGX2PL2w){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwK_HO9-UsU){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLjOIef0Tc){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

## Tokyo

There's two airports, NRT (Narita) and HND (Haneda). HND is closer/cheaper to Tokyo but honestly it's about the same, I usually find flights cheaper to NRT.

We came to Tokyo previously so we feel more familiar, wanted to get sleep off our jetlag (Day 0, 1) before venturing off to Osaka. We booked roundtrip in/out of NRT so we came back to Tokyo at the end of our trip (Day 11, 12) to get our souvenirs.

### Stay at

We stayed at Courtyard Tokyo Station & Courtyard Ginza Station, Ginza is better.

### Visit
- If taking the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) out of Tokyo Station, visit [Ekiben Matsuri](https://matcha-jp.com/en/3653){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> to get your bento box. It's famous across Japan, and eating bento boxes in Shinkansen is a thing, so take advantage of it. Here's a video reviewing bentos from [Tokyo Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w9Jv9YXC8g){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
    - You can also get bentos from [Shinagawa Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HQtEmR0N-0&vl=en){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->  too if you are taking the Shinkansen from there.
    <br><img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/tokyo_bento.jpg" width="80%"><br>
- Take the [Marikart](https://kart.st/en/tokyobay.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> around Tokyo.
    - There are a lot of different locations, you can't wear nintendo custumes anymore, but gokart on the streets of Tokyo, definitely a once in a lifetime experience.
    <br><img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/tokyo_marikart.jpg" width="80%"><br>
    - You need a international drivers license, so go to your local AAA to get one.


### Food Recs

- [Excellent] Get your snack souvenirs from [Niki no Kashi](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1066461-d10308771-Reviews-Niki_no_Kashi_No_1-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. The stores (multiple in close proximity) are huge and there's great selections.
- [Excellent] Pizza at [Savoy Tomato to Cheese](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129734-d9899364-Reviews-Savoy_Tomato_to_Cheese-Azabujuban_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, go at dinner, get the Tuna Pizza.
    - Pizza in Japan!?! I know, it's weird, but we loved this place and came here **twice**.
    <br><img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/tokyo_savoy1.jpg" width="80%"><br>
    - Check out chef's [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuki.motokura/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, [us here!](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3DVwD2geWE/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, [map](https://goo.gl/maps/yf3PLGmm1StYugGNA).
    - There are multiple locations, our friend recommended this branch because Yuki is awesome.
    - Tuna pizza is only for dinner. Pretty inexpensive, maybe $12-15. There's usually no wait early in the night (think 6pm).
    <br><img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/tokyo_savoy2.jpg" width="80%"><br>
    - Their Tuna is from a special shop/distributor that's renowned for the quality.
- [Good] Tsukiji Fish Market Street Food. See this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hWUBCbUj5g){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. Tsukiji inner market has moved to a new location, but the outer market stayed about the same, the food is pretty good, a little bit overpriced in certain shops.
- [Ok] Tonkatsu - It's good, worth a try, some of our friends LOVED it, we thought it was fine
    - Found this [list](https://thepursuitoffoodperfection.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/best-tonkatsu-in-tokyo-japan/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> that's helpful to choose between locations.
    - They have weird hours and closed on random weekdays, and long queues so plan ahead/go early.


## Osaka

Osaka is known for being a nightlife city, we aren't super into nightlife, so we thought Osaka was okay. Supposed to be known for street food and food in general too, but didn't really find a lot of things extraordinary in our stay.

### Stay at

We had a lot of hotel points so we stayed at [Osaka St. Regis](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/osaxr-the-st-regis-osaka/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. Definitely felt out of place, not worth the points in my opinion (you should spend it in Kyoto - below) but was a very nice hotel.

### Visit
- [Good] [Minoo Falls](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4019.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. Short hike, do try their freshly fried maple leaves.


### Food Recs
- [Excellent] [Kuromon Ichiba Market](https://www.tokyozebra.com/blog/kuromon){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
    - The best place in Osaka, go to [Fukahiro](https://www.osp.osaka-info.jp/en/facility/detail?id=72){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> to get sashimi bowl for ~$10USD and it was one of the freshest we had in Japan.
    - Another list of recs [here](https://migrationology.com/kuromon-ichiba-market-osaka/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
- [Very good] [Mizuno](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298566-d1664126-Reviews-Mizuno-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_---> for their Okonomiyaki. Honestly Okonomiyaki doesn't look that good to us, but this place loads it up with seafood and it surprised us with how *delicious* it was.
- [Good] [Rikuro Ojisan Cheesecake](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298566-d1668251-Reviews-Rikuro_Ojisan_no_Mise_Namba_Honten-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> There are multiple locations. Jiggly cheesecake, pretty good.
- [Ok] [Dotonbori Kukuru](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298566-d3751894-Reviews-Dotonbori_Kukuru_Main_Shop-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_---> for their Takoyaki, famous.
- [Ok] [Moeyo Mensuke](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14127730-d10637776-Reviews-Moeyo_Mensuke-Fukushima_Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> has duck ramen, we thought it was good but not *crazy* good.


## Kobe

It's pretty close to Osaka, so we took a day trip just to have Kobe beef. Kobe beef is traditionally enjoyed through Teppanyaki, but we did Sukiyaki instead because we wanted to.

### Food Recs
<img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/kobe_ishida.png" width="70%">
- [Excellent] Kobe Beef Sukiyaki at [Ishida](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%81%99%E3%81%8D%E3%82%84%E3%81%8D+%E3%81%97%E3%82%83%E3%81%B6%E3%81%97%E3%82%83%E3%81%B6+%E7%A5%9E%E6%88%B8%E7%89%9B+%E7%9F%B3%E7%94%B0/@34.6944384,135.1907344,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60008ee4f493fe4f:0xce1c0e72019c0339!8m2!3d34.694434!4d135.1929231?shorturl=1){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
    - It's expensive, like very expensive. We really wanted to experience Kobe beef so we decided to splurge.
    - The location is a little bit hard to find, so go early, it's on the 3rd floor, map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%81%99%E3%81%8D%E3%82%84%E3%81%8D+%E3%81%97%E3%82%83%E3%81%B6%E3%81%97%E3%82%83%E3%81%B6+%E7%A5%9E%E6%88%B8%E7%89%9B+%E7%9F%B3%E7%94%B0/@34.6944384,135.1907344,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60008ee4f493fe4f:0xce1c0e72019c0339!8m2!3d34.694434!4d135.1929231?shorturl=1){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
    - Youtube guide [here](https://youtu.be/IuYiYzmO3qk?t=1054){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
    - Ishida is a chain that has a really well regarded Teppanyaki establishment too. So if you want to enjoy Kobe beef at a more traditional setting, check out their Teppanyaki stores.

## Extras

We went to Japan in 2018 for a few days of layover before going to Hong Kong to visit family. Here's a couple of highlights

### Hakone
### Stay at
### Visit

- [Hakone Shrine - Mototsumiya](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5204.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> to visit the Torii (water gate).
<br><img src="/assets/images/2019_japan/hakone_torii.jpeg" width="80%"><br>


### Yokohama

- Make a trip to the [Ramen Museum](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298173-d320019-Reviews-Shinyokohama_Ramen_Museum-Yokohama_Kanagawa_Prefecture_Kanto.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> you will not regret it. The ramen sold at the shops there is some of the best in Tokyo. Bring lots of cash and come hungry. More info [here](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3202.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

## Other Resources I like
[Youtube: Paolo from TOKYO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCixD9UbKvDxzGNiPC_fgHyA){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- Really great content on a variety of topics, showing both popular and hole-in-the-wall locations.

[https://www.japan-guide.com/](https://www.japan-guide.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- The city guides are sometimes hit/miss, but really excellent content on how to get around from airport to city and good general information on how to travel well in Japan.
