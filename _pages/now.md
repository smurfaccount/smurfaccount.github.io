**Right now**, I am working as a Data Analyst at MobilityWare, serving at [CrossLife Bible Church](https://www.crosslifebiblechurch.org/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, raising our golden retriever Acorn with my wife Angela.

Like *always*...
- Struggling through daily life trying to be faithful to God and live a maximized life for His glory alone.
- Wrestling with how to do more better through better habits, tools and systems.
